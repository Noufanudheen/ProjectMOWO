## 🚀 Overview

**Project MOWO** is a hyper-optimized web application crafted to deliver the smoothest possible public transport routing experience. By stripping away heavy frameworks and relying on **hand-crafted HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**, MOWO achieves unparalleled performance.

It's designed to run beautifully on everything from the latest flagship phones to older, resource-constrained devices, ensuring accessibility for everyone.

## ✨ Core Philosophy & Features

### 🪶 Ultra-Lightweight Architecture
- **Zero Dependencies**: Built without heavy frontend frameworks (React, Vue, Angular) or backend requirements.
- **Pure Static Stack**: Just HTML, CSS, and JS. No build steps, no complex compilation.
- **Instant Load**: optimized assets and efficient code ensure the app loads in milliseconds.

### 🎨 Relaxing & Fluid Animations
- **Custom CSS Design**: Every transition and interaction is hand-written to be smooth and stress-free.
- **Reverse-Flow Expansion**: Opening a search box gracefully slides other elements away, creating a calm, decluttered focus mode.
- **Jank-Free**: Animations are optimized for 60fps performance even on lower-end hardware.

### ⚡ Optimized for All Devices
- **Manual DOM Manipulation**: By avoiding Virtual DOM overhead, we interact directly with the browser for maximum efficiency.
- **Memory Efficient**: Uses minimal RAM, making it perfect for older smartphones.
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Critical features work everywhere.

### �️ Intelligent Features
- **Smart Search**: Instant filtering of stops and routes.
- **Local Caching**: Data is intelligently cached in the browser (IndexedDB) for offline-like speed.
- **Scrollable Interfaces**: Neat, contained scroll zones prevent layout clutter.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Structure**: Semantic **HTML5**
- **Style**: Hand-crafted **CSS3** with CSS Variables & Flexbox
- **Logic**: Optimized **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **Data**: Client-side object storage (IndexedDB)
